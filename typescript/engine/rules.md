# rules for initial data

- the x and y value has to be between 0 and 100.?? why if i need to move things out of screen then??
- but - i need some mechanism "locked to screen mode" in which case the comp has to be with in screen. so the final_data of x should not push the comp off stage- so ww need to find the width of the comp during animation.
